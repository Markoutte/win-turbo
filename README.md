# Win Turbo

<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin enables Windows OS high-precision timer in JetBrains IDEs:

[LockSupport.parkNanos() Under the Hood and the Curious Case of Parking, Part II: Windows](https://hazelcast.com/blog/locksupport-parknanos-under-the-hood-and-the-curious-case-of-parking-part-ii-windows/)
<!-- Plugin description end -->

Build the plugin with `gradle build`.

Open Search Everywhere (Ctrl + Shift + A) and find 'Win Turbo Mode' to enable or disable it. 
This implementation doesn't remember the choice therefore the option should be enabled after IDE restart.
